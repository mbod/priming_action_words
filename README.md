## Priming action word processing in physical activity messages

### Overview

The involvement of motor sensory regions in response to action words (especially verbs) has been 
demonstrated in a number of studies. Although not uncontentious, theories of grounded or emboided cognition explain 
as the result of the mental simulation of the actions described thereby engaging these neural regions. 
Additional studies have probed the inverse, that is, the effect of motor actions such as directed hand or foot 
movements (e.g. pushing, twisting, kicking etc.) on the semantic processsing of sentences containing these words.
Beyond experimental motor actions, other studies have tested the effect of specific training in these actions 
during the study period, while others have looked the role of expertise in activities (e.g. volley ball players 
compared to non-players) in response to related action verbs.

Persausive health messages that aim to increase physical activity and combat sedentary behavior frequently contain 
action verbs and language relating to specific movements.
